# Measuring Tool

This is a site where you can measure the size of objects.

## Getting Started

Just choose whether you want the units to be in mm, cm, in or px, then place the object you want to measure up against your screen, and drag the corner of the box until it fits the size of the object. The height and width will then be given below in the chosen unit.

### Prerequisites

Nothing. Just Django.
